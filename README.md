    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

## Usage

```javascript
import resolve from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/ndarray-base-dtype-resolve-enum@deno/mod.js';
```

#### resolve( dtype )

Returns the enumeration constant associated with an ndarray data type value.

```javascript
import str2enum from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/ndarray-base-dtype-str2enum@deno/mod.js';

var v = resolve( 'float64' );
// returns <number>

v = resolve( str2enum( 'float64' ) );
// returns <number>
```

If unable to resolve an enumeration constant, the function returns `null`.

```javascript
var v = resolve( 'beep' );
// returns null
```

## Notes

-   Downstream consumers of this function should **not** rely on specific integer values (e.g., `INT8 == 0`). Instead, the function should be used in an opaque manner.

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
import resolve from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/ndarray-base-dtype-resolve-enum@deno/mod.js';

var v = resolve( 'float64' );
// returns <number>

v = resolve( 'float32' );
// returns <number>

v = resolve( 'int32' );
// returns <number>

v = resolve( 'int16' );
// returns <number>

v = resolve( 'int8' );
// returns <number>

v = resolve( 'uint32' );
// returns <number>

v = resolve( 'uint16' );
// returns <number>

v = resolve( 'uint8' );
// returns <number>
